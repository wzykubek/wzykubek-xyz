Welcome to my blog. I'm not very active here, so I recommend using the [RSS feed](/en/blog/index.xml). The whole content of each post is always available to read through RSS, so there is no need to enter the website.

The content here will be mainly focused on Linux, self-hosting, ~~piracy~~ privacy, security, and technology in general. I will share some tips, thoughts, and manifests about different topics. **I want to admit that content shared here is entirely human-created.**

My goal now is to post at least once every two months, but forcing myself to write an article about nothing interesting that won't be read by anyone is not in my bingo.

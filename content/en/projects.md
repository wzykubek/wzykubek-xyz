## Active
There are projects I'm currently working on or keep an eye on issues. Mostly tools I just use by my own, so I have an interest to improve them.

+ [Sieveman](https://github.com/wzykubek/sieveman) - ManageSieve protocol client written in Go. Can be used in two modes: CLI and interactive.
Built in modular approach and can be used as library as well. *Not production ready.*
+ [Licensmith](https://github.com/wzykubek/licensmith) - Command line utility for generating *LICENSE* files. It respects your Git configuration.
+ [rEFInd Colorizer](https://github.com/wzykubek/refind-colorizer) - Simple tool for creating custom colorschemes for [rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) bootloader.

## Archived
Projects that I've created and no longer maintain, but decided to keep for future reference. Keep in mind that this software can be vulnerable, because it's not updated for a long time.

+ [OpenFM Web](https://github.com/wzykubek/openfm-web) - Web client for Polish internet radio. Built with pure JavaScript.
+ [OpenFM Qt](https://github.com/wzykubek/openfm-qt) - Desktop client for the same radio.
+ [Telegrask](https://github.com/wzykubek/telegrask) - Flask-inspired Telegram bot microframework for Python.
+ [ByteBird](https://github.com/wzykubek/7seg-ByteBird) - This is very simple game for Raspberry Pi 7 segment display hat, I've created during lockdown. 
This deserves some more attention, so I will probably write a blog post about it.
+ [FOSS Stuff List](https://github.com/wzykubek/FOSS_Stuff) - Something like Awesome List for free and open-source software alternatives. Probably outdated, because in latest few years a lot of new software was born, but still quite usefull. Maybe one day I will resume this project in some other form, who knows.

Some older projects have been deleted permanently or archived on private repositories.

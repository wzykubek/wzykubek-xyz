Hello! :wave: I'm **Wiktor** - [:poland: Polish](/pl) computer science freak and :penguin: Linux nerd.

I love everything about computers, but especially: free software, Linux and servers, software development, hacking, [music production](https://lugnx.xyz), graphic design...

Oh, that's a lot, but I didn't even named a half of the things. I don't have enough time in my life to do everything I want to do, 
but on this website I will share any kind of content for which I found some time and put enough effort.

[Here](https://link.brono.cloud/bookmarks/shared) are some interesting links I share.

Hello! :wave: I'm **Wiktor** - [:poland: Polish](/pl) computer science freak and :penguin: Linux nerd.

I love everything about computers, but especially: free software, Linux, servers, software development, hacking, music production, graphic design...

Oh, that's a lot, but I didn't even named a half of the things. I don't have enough time in my life to do everything I want to do, but on this website I will share any kind of content for which I found some time and put enough effort.

In free time I often write some code, mainly in Go nowadays. I'm not employed as a developer, *not yet*. You can view some of my projects [here](projects), or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/wzykubek) profile.

Furthermore, I created a blog recently, which you can access [here](blog).
